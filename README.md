# Hey, I'm Imrane 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm currently learning Python and building small projects to improve my problem-solving and coding skills. I’m curious about how technology works and enjoy experimenting with code to better understand how things are built.

## 🧠 What I'm Learning
- Python fundamentals (functions, conditionals, loops, lists)
- Clean and readable code
- Building logic step-by-step through mini projects

## 🧪 Projects
Here are a few small but meaningful projects I've been working on:

You can find these in my [`python-mini-projects`](https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/python-mini-projects) repo.

## 🎯 Goals
- Keep improving my Python skills through hands-on practice
- Learn how code can support smart systems and automation
- Build a foundation for future opportunities in tech and AI

Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to explore my repos 👨‍💻
